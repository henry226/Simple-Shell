# Simple-Shell

### 1. The first internal command I did was “help” to see what the internal commands are.  
```sh
ML>> help
Meng-Tse Li's Shell
The folloowing are built in:
cd
exit
help
users
history
!!
!n
```

### 2. Then I do external command “ls” and internal “cd” to see and change my file directory.
```sh
ML>> ls
Makefile myshell myshell.c
ML>> cd ../
ML>> ls
Desktop Documents Downloads examples.desktop hello hello.c hi Makefile Music myshell myshell.c Pictures Public shell shell.c Templates text text.c Video
```
